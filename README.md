# WhyDRS Database Front-End Revamp

![WhyDRS Logo](assets/images/WhyDRS_Logo_transparent_background.png)

## üìã Project Overview

This branch contains a complete redesign and modernization of the front-end interface for the WhyDRS Database website. The WhyDRS Database is a comprehensive, open-source, nonprofit resource that provides information about Direct Registration Systems (DRS) for publicly traded companies.

### Current Status

This is a work in progress that significantly improves the user interface and experience of the original WhyDRS Database site. The revamp focuses on enhancing search capabilities, visual design, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility while maintaining the core database functionality.
