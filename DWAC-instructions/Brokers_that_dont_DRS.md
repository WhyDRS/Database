# **If broker cannot DRS transfer:**

## **Intro/disclaimer:**
**${name of broker}** does not DRS transfer shares, so you need to transfer your shares to another broker that can DRS transfer. **{if outside US}** A popular route has been through Interactive Brokers (IBKR), as they are available internationally and can DRS transfer for $5(US). For this example, IBKR is being used. **{if inside US}** A popular route has been through Fidelity, as they are able to reliably DRS transfer for free, and it’s a very simple process to request it. Fidelity have also been known to reimburse transfer fees when moving to them **{(up to $75)}**


**{if outside US}** 

The quickest way is to open an Interactive Broker account, buy a share, and request a DRS transfer. While you wait for your **${transfer agent name}** account to be created, you can transfer your shares from **${name of broker}** to IBKR with a Basic FOP Transfer, then from IBKR to **${transfer agent name}** via DRS transfer for a $5(US) fee.**}**


**{If a fee is charged}**

**${name of broker}** charges a **${expected fee}** fee to transfer to another broker (Basic FOP Transfer and/or ACAT Transfer). This means each time you want to transfer a specific stock (no matter how many shares) you are charged **${expected fee}**. You will need to make sure you have **${expected fee}** settled in your account before you can transfer.**}**


**{If free to transfer}**

**${name of broker}** can transfer to another broker for free.**}**


**{If no info on fees available}**

**${name of broker}** may charge a fee for each Basic FOP Transfer. This means each time you want to transfer a specific stock (no matter how many shares) you are charged a fee.**}**

### Elana Trading

**${name of broker}** uses SaxoBank as it's broker for global markets, so they charge an extortionate $1000(US) to DRS transfer.

As it's the highest fee to DRS transfer, this guide focuses on transferring to a broker that can DRS transfer for less. **${name of broker}** offers broker to broker transfers for just 12BGN + %1 of the market value of the assets being transferred. Although they may use Saxo Bank's fees for non-Bulgarian stocks, in which case it is €25 per transfer (recently Saxo increased this in Belgium to a €75 fee).

A popular route to transfer shares from **${name of broker}** to **${transfer agent name}** has been through Interactive Brokers (IBKR) as they can DRS transfer reliably for $5.



### eToro
Please note that the $100 fee is per stock, and each of your positions within that stock may be treated separately and fractionals of each position will be liquidated in the process, the cash will stay in your eToro account.

### Intesa Sanpaolo
Normally you send the Letter of Instruction IBKR generates, but this is no longer appropriate for ${name of broker}, instead you must write your own Letter of Instruction, take it into a local branch and sign it in front of them. The following has worked for another investor:


"il sottoscritto [nome e cognome] Titolare del deposito titoli [Numero di conto ${name of broker}] chiede di trasferire tutti i titoli presenti (oppure se si tratta di un trasferimento parziale indicare ISIN (L'ISIN di ${company name} è: ${ISIN}) e quantità da trasferire) a favore del deposito [Numero di conto IBKR] a me Intestato presso Interactive Brokers


si comunica che il trasferimento avviene senza cambio d’intestazione e per qualsiasi comunicazione con il ricevente, la mail da utilizzare è: fop-transfer-in@interactivebrokers.com"


We recommend you take two copies with you. One for the bank, and one for your own records.

Now you are able to request the DRS transfer from IBKR to ${transfer agent name}. To do this you can follow our guide on how to DRS transfer from IBKR (link to IBKR guide here?).



{if inside US}
After your shares reach Fidelity:
