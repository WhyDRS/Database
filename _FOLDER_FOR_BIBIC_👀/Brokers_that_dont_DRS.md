If broker cannot DRS transfer:

## Intro/disclaimer:
${name of broker} does not DRS transfer shares, so you need to transfer your shares to another broker that can DRS transfer. {if outside US} A popular route has been through Interactive Brokers (IBKR), as they are available internationally and can DRS transfer for $5(US). For this example, IBKR is being used.} {if inside US} A popular route has been through Fidelity, as they are able to reliably DRS transfer for free, and it’s a very simple process to request it. Fidelity have also been known to reimburse transfer fees when moving to them (up to $75)}


{if outside US} The quickest way is to open an Interactive Broker account, buy a share, and request a DRS transfer. While you wait for your ${transfer agent name} account to be created, you can transfer your shares from ${name of broker} to IBKR with a Basic FOP Transfer, then from IBKR to ${transfer agent name} via DRS transfer for a $5(US) fee.}


{If a fee is charged}
${name of broker} charges a ${expected fee} fee to transfer to another broker (Basic FOP Transfer and/or ACAT Transfer). This means each time you want to transfer a specific stock (no matter how many shares) you are charged ${expected fee}. You will need to make sure you have ${expected fee} settled in your account before you can transfer.}

{If free to transfer}
${name of broker} can transfer to another broker for free.}

{If no info on fees available}
${name of broker} may charge a fee for each Basic FOP Transfer. This means each time you want to transfer a specific stock (no matter how many shares) you are charged a fee.}

Intesa Sanpaolo
Normally you send the Letter of Instruction IBKR generates, but this is no longer appropriate for ${name of broker}, instead you must write your own Letter of Instruction, take it into a local branch and sign it in front of them. The following has worked for another investor:


"il sottoscritto [nome e cognome] Titolare del deposito titoli [Numero di conto ${name of broker}] chiede di trasferire tutti i titoli presenti (oppure se si tratta di un trasferimento parziale indicare ISIN (L'ISIN di ${company name} è: ${ISIN}) e quantità da trasferire) a favore del deposito [Numero di conto IBKR] a me Intestato presso Interactive Brokers


si comunica che il trasferimento avviene senza cambio d’intestazione e per qualsiasi comunicazione con il ricevente, la mail da utilizzare è: fop-transfer-in@interactivebrokers.com"


We recommend you take two copies with you. One for the bank, and one for your own records.

Now you are able to request the DRS transfer from IBKR to ${transfer agent name}. To do this you can follow our guide on how to DRS transfer from IBKR (link to IBKR guide here?).




{if inside US}
